# Macron App

Utility to edit your cron file automatically.


On the mac, wifi keeps turning back on at start up automatically, but no need for this because you have a usb ethernet connection.

Macron turns off the airport (wifi) adapter for mac and also schedules an alarm (crontab) task to turn it off at restart too.



## Downloading the program

[Arm Macs]( https://macron-app.b-cdn.net/arm64/Macron)

[Intel Macs](https://macron-app.b-cdn.net/amd64/Macron) 

I have only tested on an intel mac.


## Other programs

There's also the [Amphetamine app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) for keeping macbook on when you close the lid for use with a screen / keyboard.
