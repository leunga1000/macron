# Macron

Utility to edit your cron file automatically.


## Example situation

On mac wifi keeps turning back on at start up, but no need for this because you have a usb ethernet connection.

Turns off airport/wifi adapter for mac and also schedules an alarm (crontab) task to turn it off at restart too.



## Downloading the program

I have only tested on an intel mac.


## Other programs

There's also the Amphetamine app for keeping macbook on when you close the lid for use with a screen / keyboard.
